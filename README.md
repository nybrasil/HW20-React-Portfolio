# HW20-React-Portfolio

# React Portfolio

## Description

This project is a professional portfolio built using React. The primary motivation behind creating this portfolio was to showcase my projects and skills to potential employers and collaborators. By utilizing React, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in modern web development technologies and set myself apart from developers with traditional, non-React portfolios. This project solves the problem of effectively displaying my work and experience in an engaging and interactive manner. Through this project, I learned how to create a dynamic, single-page application using React, as well as how to implement routing and manage component states.
